This is an implementation of a subset of Scheme written in Python.

The supported forms are **quote**, **set!**, **define**, **if**, **cond**, **lambda**, **let**, **begin**, **and**, **or** and function calls. Some standard library functions are supported aswell; to find out which ones, see global_env.py

To see some example programs, and how to run the interpreter, check out the
test_all.py file.
